SI just got creen List (WaveContV3.cpp)

MAIN MENU
- 2x2 grid of top-level options: LOAD, RECORD, PERFORM, PLAY.

SHIFT MENU
- Vertical list of SAVE and DELETE options.

LOAD MENU
- Scrollable list of WAV files; highlights selected file; used for loading.
- In delete mode, the same list is used to select a file to delete.
- Empty/blocked states:
  - "SD NOT MOUNTED" when SD card is missing or not ready.
  - "NO WAV FILES" when there are no files (normal load mode).
  - "NO FILES" when there are no files (delete mode).

LOAD TARGET
- "LOAD TO?" with boxes for PLAY, BAKE, and PERFORM.

DELETE CONFIRM
- "DELETE?" plus filename and "R=YES L=NO" prompt.

RECORD SOURCE SELECT
- "SOURCE:" with LINE IN or MICROPHONE options.

RECORD READY
- Animated "RECORD LINE IN" or "RECORD MICROPHONE" plus "READY".

RECORD COUNTDOWN
- Large countdown number with film reel graphic.

RECORDING
- "RECORDING: 5 SEC MAX" plus live waveform.

RECORD REVIEW
- Waveform screen titled "RECORDED PLAYBACK".

PERFORM
- 2x2 grid of rectangles.
- Vertical labels on the left side of each box: EDT (top left), AMP (top right), FLT (bottom left), FX (bottom right).
- When a sample is loaded to PERFORM, playback is 5-voice polyphonic resampling (pitch follows speed).
- When a sample is baked, PERFORM uses 5-voice multisample playback.
- AMP box shows four vertical faders labeled A, D, S, R.
- AMP A/R faders map to 5-1000 ms fades (20 ms steps) at the start/end of the sample.
- AMP R release starts when a MIDI note-off is received for a voice.
- FLT box shows two vertical faders labeled C and R.
- Hold SHIFT while FLT is selected to pick C/R with encoder L; encoder R adjusts the highlighted fader.
- C controls a per-voice 4-pole low-pass cutoff (exp scaled, max 20kHz). R controls resonance (Q 0-5, starts at 0).
- FX box shows four vertical wet/dry faders labeled S, C, D, R.
- S controls tape saturation depth.
- D is a 300ms ping-pong delay wet/dry fader (~6 repeats).
- Hold SHIFT while AMP is selected to pick A/D/S/R with encoder L; encoder R adjusts the highlighted fader.
- Hold SHIFT while FX is selected to pick S/C/D/R with encoder L; encoder R adjusts the highlighted fader.
- C controls chorus depth (slow rate).

PLAY WAVEFORM
- Shows loaded sample waveform with trim brackets and title (sample name).
- If baked performance is active, shows baked view with attack/release lines.

NO SAMPLE LOADED
- Message: NO SAMPLE LOADED / PLEASE LOAD A / SAMPLE FROM / THE MAIN MENU.
