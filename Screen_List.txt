SI just got creen List (WaveContV3.cpp)

MAIN MENU
- 2x2 grid of top-level options: LOAD, RECORD, PERFORM, PLAY.

SHIFT MENU
- Vertical list of SAVE and DELETE options.

LOAD MENU
- Scrollable list of WAV files; highlights selected file; used for loading.
- In delete mode, the same list is used to select a file to delete.
- Empty/blocked states:
  - "SD NOT MOUNTED" when SD card is missing or not ready.
  - "NO WAV FILES" when there are no files (normal load mode).
  - "NO FILES" when there are no files (delete mode).

LOAD TARGET
- Three equal rectangles with diagonal labels: PERFORM, PLAY, BAKE.
- Encoder L selects target; Encoder R confirms.

DELETE CONFIRM
- "DELETE?" plus filename and "R=YES L=NO" prompt.

RECORD SOURCE SELECT
- "SOURCE:" with LINE IN or MICROPHONE options.

RECORD READY
- Animated "RECORD LINE IN" or "RECORD MICROPHONE" plus "READY".

RECORD COUNTDOWN
- Large countdown number with film reel graphic.

RECORDING
- "RECORDING: 5 SEC MAX" plus live waveform.

RECORD REVIEW
- Waveform screen titled "RECORDED PLAYBACK".

RECORD TARGET SELECT
- Appears after Record Review for recorded samples.
- Three equal rectangles with diagonal labels: PERFORM, PLAY, BAKE.
- Encoder L selects target; Encoder R confirms.
- PERFORM loads the sample to PERFORM and enters PERFORM mode.
- PLAY loads the sample to PLAY and enters PLAY mode.
- BAKE goes to the CONFIRM BAKE screen.

PERFORM
- 2x2 grid of rectangles.
- Vertical labels on the left side of each box: EDT (top left), AMP (top right), FLT (bottom left), FX (bottom right).
- EDT box shows a mini waveform preview of the loaded sample.
- When a sample is loaded to PERFORM, playback is 5-voice polyphonic resampling (pitch follows speed).
- When a sample is baked, PERFORM uses 5-voice multisample playback.
- AMP box shows four vertical faders labeled A, D, S, R.
- AMP A/R faders map to 5-1000 ms fades (20 ms steps) at the start/end of the sample.
- AMP R release starts when a MIDI note-off is received for a voice.
- FLT box shows two vertical faders labeled C and R.
- Hold SHIFT while FLT is selected to pick C/R with encoder L; encoder R adjusts the highlighted fader.
- C controls a per-voice 4-pole low-pass cutoff (exp scaled, max 20kHz). R controls resonance (Q 0-5, starts at 0).
- FX box shows four vertical wet/dry faders labeled S, C, D, R.
- S controls tape saturation depth.
- D is a 300ms ping-pong delay wet/dry fader (~6 repeats).
- Hold SHIFT while AMP is selected to pick A/D/S/R with encoder L; encoder R adjusts the highlighted fader.
- Hold SHIFT while FX is selected to pick S/C/D/R with encoder L; encoder R adjusts the highlighted fader.
- C controls chorus depth (slow rate).

FX DETAIL SCREENS
- Accessed by highlighting FX in PERFORM, holding SHIFT, selecting an effect (S, C, D, R), and pressing Encoder R.
- SATURATION, CHORUS, DELAY, and REVERB screens show their label centered at the top.
- REVERB shows a left-side stacked set of three rectangles labeled HALL, SPRG, SHMR.
- REVERB shows four faders to the right labeled Pre, Dmp, Dcy, Wet; Encoder L selects a fader and Encoder R adjusts.
- Pre is 0-100 ms predelay, Dmp damps reverb highs, Dcy is 10 ms-4 s (~80 ms/step), Wet matches the PERFORM R fader.
- Press Encoder L to return to PERFORM.

EDT WINDOW
- Accessed by highlighting EDT in PERFORM and pressing Encoder R.
- Waveform view with start/end brackets (trim) for the PERFORM playback window; top label shows the sample name without .wav.
- Encoder L adjusts start; Encoder R adjusts end. Hold SHIFT for fine steps.
- Shows a vertical playhead line while the sample is playing.

PLAY WAVEFORM
- Shows loaded sample waveform with trim brackets and title (sample name).
- If baked performance is active, shows baked view with attack/release lines.

NO SAMPLE LOADED
- Message: NO SAMPLE LOADED / PLEASE LOAD A / SAMPLE FROM / THE MAIN MENU.

CONFIRM BAKE
- "Confirm Bake?" with YES/NO options.

SD INIT
- "INITIALIZING SD" with animated dots and attempt counter.
- Result state: "SD INIT OK" or "SD INIT FAILED".

SAVE
- "SAVING" with progress bar.
- Result state: "SAVE OK" or "SAVE FAILED" (shows filename on success).
